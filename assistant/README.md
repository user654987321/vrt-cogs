Relatedness threshold between 0 and 1 to include in embeddings during chat<br/>

Questions are converted to embeddings and compared against stored embeddings to pull the most relevant, this is the score that is derived from that comparison<br/>

**Hint**: The closer to 1 you get, the more deterministic and accurate the results may be, just don't be *too* strict or there wont be any results.<br/>

This setting is exclusive to the gpt-5 model and affects how detailed the model's responses are.<br/>
 - Usage: `[p]assistant verbosity`
## [p]assistant embedmethod
Cycle between embedding methods<br/>

**Dynamic** embeddings mean that the embeddings pulled are dynamically appended to the initial prompt for each individual question.<br/>
When each time the user asks a question, the previous embedding is replaced with embeddings pulled from the current question, this reduces token usage significantly<br/>

**Static** embeddings are applied in front of each user message and get stored with the conversation instead of being replaced with each question.<br/>

**Hybrid** embeddings are a combination, with the first embedding being stored in the conversation and the rest being dynamic, this saves a bit on token usage.<br/>

**User** embeddings are injected into the beginning of the prompt as the first user message.<br/>

Dynamic embeddings are helpful for Q&A, but not so much for chat when you need to retain the context pulled from the embeddings. The hybrid method is a good middle ground<br/>
 - Usage: `[p]assistant embedmethod`
